## Geschwindigkeitsficken - Speedfuck

[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an esoteric (aka joke)
programming language invented by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. This project aims at
compiling and more importantly optimizing code written in Brainfuck. If you
want to know more about optimizing brainfuck i recommend [Mats Linander](http://calmerthanyouare.org/2015/01/07/optimizing-brainfuck.html)s blog
post about it. There is also a list of similar projects [on this page](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/esotope-bfc/wiki/Comparison).

### Name

The name originated in a skype chat many years ago. [@Webfreak001](https://github.com/WebFreak001) had the idea of
writing an optimizing brainfuck compiler calling it "Speedfuck" - a translator
bot automatically translated it to "Geschwindigkeitsficken" from the german word
for Speed (Geschwindigkeit) and the colloquial word for having Sex (ficken).

### Compiling

```sh
git clone https://github.com/M4GNV5/Geschwindigkeitsficken.git
cd Geschwindigkeitsficken

make
```

### Examples

Compiling the popular Hello World! program
```b
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
```
outputs
```sh
puts("Hello World!\n")
```

Well duh! But thats kind of boring so lets take simpler programs and disable constant folding:
```sh
$ bin/speedfuck -Oconstfold -Otrailing -code '+++++>>++<<-' -pseudo
p[0] += 3
p[2] += 2

#Here you can already see one of the most common optimizations applied to
# brainfuck: grouping +, -, > and <. Note how the statements are reordered so
# that the last two - can be grouped with the first five + even though there is
# code in between.

$ bin/speedfuck -Oconstfold -Otrailing -code '++++>>++<<-[-]' -pseudo
p[0] = 0
p[2] += 2

#Another common optimization is [-] which sets a cell to zero, this also turns
# all previous changes to p[0] to noops so they are removed.

$ bin/speedfuck -Oconstfold -Otrailing -code '++[->+++<]' -pseudo
p[0] += 2
p[1] += p[0] * 3
p[0] = 0

#the above loop is called a copy loop as it adds three to p[1] and subtracts one
# from p[0] until p[0] is zero. Thus the loop can be optimized to adding
# 3 * p[0] to p[1] and setting p[0] to zero. This is called a "copyloop"

$ bin/speedfuck -Oconstfold -Otrailing -code '++[->+++>++<<]' -pseudo
p[0] += 2
p[2] += p[0] * 2
p[1] += p[0] * 3
p[0] = 0

#copyloops still work with multiple multiplications, in fact the set to zero
# loop [-] is just a special copyloop with zero multiplications.

$ bin/speedfuck -Oconstfold -code '++>+++[->++++<]<++[->>+++<<]>>++.' -pseudo
p[0] += 4
p[1] += 3
p[2] += p[1] * 4 + p[0] * 3 + 2
putchar(p[2])

#The above brainfuck code might look complicated at first but in fact it's just
# two copy loops which both add to p[2]. Note how the p[0] += 4 is combined
# from the two ++ before and after the first copyloop and how the two copyloops
# optimize to a single p[2] += ... statement.
```

### Command line options

#### Generic
Either `-i` or `-code` must be given.
- `-i <file>` specifies an input file
- `-o <file>` specifies the output file (default: `a.out`)
- `-code <code>` passes code through a command line option rather than reading it from a file
- `-pseudo` output pseudo C-like code rather than a compiled executable
- `-keep` keep generated assembly files and put them in the working directory

#### Optimization
By default all optimizations are enabled and can be disabled using the specific
`-O` switch. Using `-Onone` disables all optimizations and allows to enable
specific ones using the corresponding `-O` switch.

- `-Onone` Disables all optimizations by default
- `-Ogroup` groups censecutive `+`, `-` and `>`, `<` together.
- `-Ocopyloop` optimize `[->++<]` to `p[1] = p[0] * 2; p[0] = 0;`
- `-Oshifts` optimize `++>++` to `p[0] += 2; p[1] += 2;`
- `-Onoop` removes noops (e.g. `++--`)
- `-Ogroup2` reorders and groups statements. e.g. `++>++<++` turns into `p[0] += 4; p[1] += 2`
- `-Oconstfold` evaluate the program as much as possible. This turns programs without `,` into single `puts` statements
- `-Otrailing` remove all instructions after the last `,` or `.`
