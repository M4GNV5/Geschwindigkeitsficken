## Geschwindigkeitsficken - Speedfuck

[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an esoteric (aka joke)
programming language invented by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993. This project aims at
compiling and more importantly optimizing code written in Brainfuck. If you
want to know more about optimizing brainfuck i recommend [Mats Linander](http://calmerthanyouare.org/2015/01/07/optimizing-brainfuck.html)s blog
post about it. There is also a list of similar projects [on this page](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/esotope-bfc/wiki/Comparison).

### Name

The name originated in a skype chat many years ago. [@Webfreak001](https://github.com/WebFreak001) had the idea of
writing an optimizing brainfuck compiler calling it "Speedfuck" - a translator
bot automatically translated it to "Geschwindigkeitsficken" from the german word
for Speed (Geschwindigkeit) and the colloquial word for having Sex (ficken).

### Compiling

```sh
git clone https://github.com/M4GNV5/Geschwindigkeitsficken.git
cd Geschwindigkeitsficken

mkdir bin
ghc -outputdir bin -isrc -o bin/speedfuck -O2 src/main.hs
```

### Examples

Compiling the popular Hello World! program
```b
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
```
outputs
```sh
puts("Hello World!\n")
```

Well duh! But thats kind of boring so lets take a simpler program and disable constant folding:
```sh
$ bin/speedfuck -Oconstfold -code '++>++[->++++<]<[->>+++<<]>>++'

# Nothing? thats because all statements after the last . are removed by -Otrailing

$ bin/speedfuck -Oconstfold -code '++>+++[->++++<]<++[->>+++<<]>>++.'
p[0] += 4
p[1] += 3
p[2] += p[1] * 4 + p[0] * 3 + 2
putchar(p[2])

#That looks more like it! as you can see it successfully optimizes the two loops
# to a single Add statement and it merged the two + at the beginning with the
# two + before the second loop. Lets see what happens to the latter optimization
# when we print cell 0 between the two adds

$ bin/speedfuck -Oconstfold -code '++>+++[->++++<]<.++[->>+++<<]>>++.'
p[0] += 2
putchar(p[0])
p[0] += 2
p[1] += 3
p[2] += p[1] * 4 + p[0] * 3 + 2
putchar(p[2])

#As you can see the two Adds are splitted into two divided by a putchar. But
# more importantly the two loops are completely optimized to a single Add even
# though the first one was before the putchar(p[0])
```

### Command line options

#### Generic
Either `-i` or `-code` must be given.
- `-i <file>` specifies an input file
- `-o <file>` specifies the output file (default: `a.out`)
- `-code <code>` passes code through a command line option rather than reading it from a file
- `-pseudo` output pseudo C-like code rather than a compiled executable

#### Optimization
By default all optimizations are enabled and can be disabled using the specific
`-O` switch. Using `-Onone` disables all optimizations and allows to enable
specific ones using the corresponding `-O` switch.

- `-Onone` Disables all optimizations by default
- `-Ogroup` groups censecutive `+`, `-` and `>`, `<` together.
- `-Ocopyloop` optimize `[->++<]` to `p[1] = p[0] * 2; p[0] = 0;`
- `-Oshifts` optimize `++>++` to `p[0] += 2; p[1] += 2;`
- `-Onoop` removes noops (e.g. `++--`)
- `-Ogroup2` reorders and groups statements. e.g. `++>++<++` turns into `p[0] += 4; p[1] += 2`
- `-Oconstfold` evaluate the program as much as possible. This turns programs without `,` into single `puts` statements
- `-Otrailing` remove all instructions after the last `,` or `.`
